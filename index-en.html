His leadership and deep understanding of the complexities of the tobacco sector were fundamental to the success of this partnership. Flávio demonstrated remarkable listening skills and tension management, transforming guidance into effective actions for the company. A notable example was his role in the negotiation that postponed the requirement for Electronic Invoices for small rural producers for two years—with a significant strategic impact. His loyalty and ability to navigate the sensitivities of the National Congress and the Executive Branch are qualities I deeply admire.
